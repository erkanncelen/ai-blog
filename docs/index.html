    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Everyting needs an intro!</h2>
    <p> Hello and welcome to miniBLOG! This is just a simple, small template designed specifically for the blog obsessives. Regarding colours, I've left everything very plain using mainly greys. These colours are all easily changed via the stylesheet. The backgorund image can be changed easily too by opening it in a graphics program and adjusting the hue/saturation. Got something to say? Say it with miniBLOG! </p>
    <p> Speaking of the background image, it was created using a pattern which can be found on squidfingers.com. </p>

    <h1><a href="#css" id="css">CSS &amp; XHTML</a></h1>
    <p> As you would expect, this web site makes use of css for its entire layout. No nasty tables here baby! The markup is also valid XHTML 1.1 strict. CSS &amp; XHTML are important for the following reasons: </p>
    <p> Anyway, this site validates as both <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS</a> and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">XHTML 1.1 Strict</a> compliant. Which is nice. </p>

    <h1><a id="about">About the Author</a></h1>
    <p> Hi! My names Jay and I'm a 19 year old web designer from England. My main projects are conducted through my website Six Shooter Media. But I also run various other sites. These include my blog, nothing special really, and, more interestingly for people setting up new sites with these templates I run a tutorials web site which gives you some good techniques for spicing up your web sites. Be it a template site or something else, there's bound to be somehting interesting there, so take a look at Pretty as a Picture. </p>
    <p> Another site of mine that you might find interesting if you're setting up a site with a free template like this is Buy a Button. There, for a great price you can purchase a link to your site in the form of a button. This link will obviously provide you site with some additional traffic which is always nice! </p>
