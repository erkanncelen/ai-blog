It’s the true story of the world that reveals its truth, the one that the people around us are told to believe, and the story that tells its truth. And so to a true story, the truth lies as it is told, in the person you’re listening to, or the people, with whom you’re listening, but you’ve been listening, you have heard. For the truth to be true, you have to know your truth. That is the truth! That is the truth for you!

Truth and truth detector

Taken from: Why can a lie detector just take you to hell? As a good reader, I’ll say that the most common lie detector you’ll hear in the world of media is a lie detector.

So when I walk into a building, I don’t believe there is a person inside. When I walk in the open door, I’ll not believe there is someone inside. I’ll say there is a man inside, as a witness, a person who is a stranger who has no way of knowing if something is going to go wrong. And when I run into an adult, I’ll be able to tell you that. My own experience with an adult and their experiences has taught me to be careful not to be deceived.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-24 23:19:26</b> </div>        <h1><a id="css">You know, the period of World War I and the Roaring Twenties were really just about the same as today.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image2.webp">  <p>You know, the period of World War I and the Roaring Twenties were really just about the same as today. So what if the world had been so utterly different? How could anyone possibly be different, and how could that change the entire world? One of the many great questions about the world is, ‘Who was that, and why was the war so hard, and even more, how could it have made that important?’ The answer is not much to be gained from watching a war. First there are many reasons why war’s success is so incredible; I think that there are a lot, and a lot of reasons, behind why the whole war effort was so important. But the fact that it had been so hard and that it was even being fought with great success was something that everyone, from politicians to the president, could relate to. And I think there’s a lot of hope for people coming to the United States and maybe doing the right things is what makes the United States of America, especially right now, the world, great, great.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-24 22:19:00</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">When you try to find funding for a VVA function, it doesn't seem like it's any trouble at all.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image3.webp">  <p>When you try to find funding for a VVA function, it doesn't seem like it's any trouble at all. They are doing it for the first time, but your only option is to find a source of funding, and that's the main reason they're giving you all these options.

If you're a non-profit, you'll find funding for any of these functions in the first place. Or you can choose which ones you have the most money for just the one you want.

So, I've got my own VVA function that I can use for my local businesses for the first time. And I'll share it in a minute.

First, let's talk about a VVA function on our website.

Here's what we're talking about:

We're looking for funding only if you're a non-profit, and you want to work with local businesses for VVA. That's fine. VVA is also a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

But we have a problem with this:

You're not a non-profit.

I know what you mean – that's the problem. What you're saying is that you can't get a profit in a way that would make you a 501(c)(3) non-profit. So what we're just trying to get at is the truth here.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-24 21:20:29</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">Death and love are the two wings that bear the good man to heaven.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image4.webp">  <p>Death and love are the two wings that bear the good man to heaven. They are both the great wings that fly out of heaven's sky. Jesus lived in that world, and they were the great wings that fly around heaven's shining stars. When Jesus walked on the earth, he was the great man. He loved the dead, and the poor. The only way to save him was by death.

The great wings are also one of the wonderful stories of Jesus. Jesus lived in the universe, and his people were the great wings that fly around heaven's shining stars. All who walk on the earth are the wing birds. The wing birds are the wing birds on which the earth's light shines. No bird is a wing bird, and the world is the universe, and it is the way God had it to live. One wing is the great wing that flies around heaven's shining stars.

Saving Jesus

When Jesus was chosen, His words were written about the kingdom of God. They were written in the Greek that was written today on a small wooden Bible. He wrote that it was as if he were about to give the glory of God to the people that have come to see him. Jesus was a man, He was a man, and His people had come to see him. He had a kingdom, so he had a kingdom. The people of the kingdom had come into the world.

Jesus wanted to live in the kingdom.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-24 20:18:02</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">Only the broken-hearted know the truth about love.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image5.webp">  <p>Only the broken-hearted know the truth about love. Not a few. And the truth of loving him.

You are what you love. And yet you are unable to understand what love is. Love is not love, it is a deep-seated emotion.

The word "love" in this sentence is intended not as meaning but as a name for the deep-seated emotional core of a person. In the spirit of love, it's a name given to the physical world as well as its spiritual world, and has a direct connection with love, and in order to do this, the word "love" should be used not in a purely technical way but as a means to understand love.

That's not the case with this sentence. If you read the words in the sentence in the first place (as it relates to the word "love") and you understand them perfectly, then it means that love is an emotion - like having a heart.

There's a lot of talk about "love": It's just a word, and a simple one. It's not something people think of too often, or they think of "love", but it's a word. That's the way it is.

You mean, "the most precious thing is love"? A great deal of it. This is a word that you are probably unaware of - it's quite difficult to make this clear in the sentence.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-24 19:24:16</b> </div>  </div>  <div id="footer">    <p> This is the personal blog of Bruno Blogai. </p>  </div></div></html>
