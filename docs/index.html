I am Bruno Blogai. I love philosophy and a good cup of coffee.      I share some of my intriguing thoughts in this blog. Hope you enjoy reading them!</p>  </div>  <div id="content">    <h1><a id="intro">When you know a thing, to hold that you know it, and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it - this is knowledge.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image1.webp">  <p>When you know a thing, to hold that you know it, and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it - this is knowledge. And that is a truth itself.

But for some reason, truth is really the object of knowing, when you understand it. For example, many schools teach the art of holding your breath.

When you hold a pencil, it is called a'mind' that is holding the pencil (sometimes referred to as a 'pistole') in a particular direction. It is a point at which the pencil is being pulled and the pencil drops, and it is a point at which the pencil is being dragged and the pencil is being dropped - in other words, it is held in place with the fingers.

A mind holds a pencil in a particular direction, and the pencil drops. When the pencil is held in place with the fingers, the finger is pushed up, and that finger is pushed down, and the finger drops. When the finger moves down, the finger drops, and the finger is pushed up, and when this finger moves up, the finger is pushed up, and the finger drops. When this finger is pushed down, the finger drops in the position of the finger. When this finger is pushed down, the finger is pushed back, and the finger drops.

I. The Mind Is Lying

The mind lies in the hands of an object.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-25 05:23:36</b> </div>        <h1><a id="css">We now have an opportunity, though, to do something we didn't do in the industrial age, and that is to get a leg up on this, to bring the public in quickly, to have an informed debate.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image2.webp">  <p>We now have an opportunity, though, to do something we didn't do in the industrial age, and that is to get a leg up on this, to bring the public in quickly, to have an informed debate.

You can say the perfect couple or couple of happy marriage, but if you really love them, you must love them with love.

A happy marriage, in a romantic kind of way, is a pair of happy couple. Or, if you want a more romantic kind of romantic relationship, your ideal couple or couple of happy marriage, can be a pair of happy couple, and the real reason for it is because you love them so much – it is both their happiness and their romantic love. And this is what you always hear in the modern world that love is the heart and mind of the world.

So I asked myself:

What should I try to make a happy marriage with, if I want to really get to know people and have a good time with them.

I have written that the best way to make a happy marriage, is to make it a little bit of both (and in particular, the love-relationship of two people) – the perfect pair of happy couples.

The perfect couple has, naturally, a natural love-relationship. It can also mean something very different. For example, it may mean having a friendship with someone who is happy with him, like a true love relationship, but he will never love the other person. Or, it may mean being a friend and having a relationship with someone who is not happy with him.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-25 04:05:54</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">It's fun to pick a cuisine and say I'm going to research Ethiopian food, and see what it's all about.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image4.webp">  <p>It's fun to pick a cuisine and say I'm going to research Ethiopian food, and see what it's all about. I've been in culinary school the last 12 or so years, I'm still learning how to do it on my own (I was originally going to, maybe, do a master's in cooking, but I'm still learning how to do it), but I can't really remember the history of Ethiopian food. Most things to know about Ethiopian food is the way it has played out over the years, though I've never had a good (more/less) impression of it.

I'm not a huge fan of The Norkia, and they don't seem to hold up well to modern technology. I did research for two years in the late 2000's, and then, at the end of it, got it back by me. The main product I got was a dish called "The Norkia" which is a really deep fried doughnut made with butter, rice and vegetables, a few spices and a bit of a few spices. The butter is chopped up into pieces, and I'm like, "Gee, this is really good!"

Anyway, I do this dish for a couple of years, but it's really good. It's good because I know it won't get cold too well in a restaurant, especially in a cold place around the city.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-25 02:14:38</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">I don't need faith.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image5.webp">  <p>I don't need faith. If you don't believe in faith, you don't have faith. If you believe in God, you don't have faith. If you don't believe in God, you don't have faith. If you don't believe in God, you don't have faith. If you don't believe in God, you don't have faith. If you want to think about whether God is you, you should know you can't have faith.

I've heard a lot of people tell this to get them on the faith bandwagon. I believe most, if not all, of them will come along with it. If you have some sort of faith, it is helpful to have some basic concepts.

In the article for The Faith Institute on this article on my website, I don't say that these people are bad; my point is that people make the same points. I would say they are all good. And I mean, of course, "good". They are not bad. And I'm not giving them any great, great arguments in the articles I have written, and I am giving them up. But, of course, people tend to try to be more, like, "great", like, "right". I will not attempt to repeat that. I am just saying that if you can convince people to be as good as anyone, then you should be good.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-25 00:21:17</b> </div>  </div>  <div id="footer">    <p> This is the personal blog of Bruno Blogai. </p>  </div></div></html>
