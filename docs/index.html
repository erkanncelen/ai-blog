I am Bruno Blogai. I love philosophy and a good cup of coffee.      I share some of my intriguing thoughts in this blog. Hope you enjoy reading them!</p>  </div>  <div id="content">    <h1><a id="intro">I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image1.webp">  <p>I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides. It's a good song and also a great songwriter. But it doesn't help to know that its a songwriter. For instance, you might not like it if your mother wrote it.

That's how this particular song came about. It is a song that I have written. My mother wrote it, of course, because she was excited and gave me a new song. The song is so amazing. At the beginning, I wasn't sure what I would write and I didn't know how to do it justice. But now that I've written it, it's been my favorite song of the year so far.

That was a great idea. But it came as a surprise to everyone who knew my mother, who would now ask me to do it, because it brought her away from me. It was surprising how much help and attention she gave me. It's a good song because the lyrics are so good. It could be a song that I would write, or a poem, or an act on the part of a singer. It's a nice song, even if you're not singing it properly.

I've noticed that when he sings a song, he does it wrong. The lyrics are written wrong. He just wrote it wrong. Not only that, but he writes an act wrong. I just don't understand how anyone could have written the song wrong.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 22:18:40</b> </div>        <h1><a id="css">A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that 'individuality' is the key to success.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image2.webp">  <p>A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that 'individuality' is the key to success. It is a time when one of the best minds in education will say something that may be true and what would be the answer if the student was not a member of the same class as the person who taught him.

The moment they are called on to answer this question, they must give this question the attention it deserves. It is the responsibility of the time: in other words the obligation of an audience to know your questions. That is what it is all about.

We have learned this day to expect a wise and thoughtful audience to care about the questioner's answers.

So, when there is a question that is asked and what the answer is if it is true and what would be the right answer if the student was not a member of the same team as the person who taught him, the time to answer is right.

After that is the time to get it right. But, the time to learn the answer can be very great. The time to get it right is when a particular person who gave that question is said to be, for instance, a teacher.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 21:20:53</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">In politics, yesterday's lie is attacked only to flatter today's.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image3.webp">  <p>In politics, yesterday's lie is attacked only to flatter today's.

This is the greatest and most dangerous lie about us, but we've all heard it.

We're an uneducated, uneducated, uneducated and undemocratic people, and these are our worst arguments against us.

This lie, this lie, this lies, this lies, this lies, is false. It has nothing to do with the United States, nothing to do with global warming. It's about the world that's the problem.

What you're saying is "I am defending you." This is the American way, and you're not listening. You are protecting the United States, and you are saying, "No. I am not defending you." This is not, "I am defending you." This is defending ourselves.

We are the people we do stand for. We are the people who will stand for whatever the American people want us to do.

You don't think so? Are we the People who will vote for you? You don't think so?

I didn't listen. I didn't listen to any of these lies, and I will not listen to anything that is not my opinion.

Now, I'm not here to make a claim.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 20:17:58</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">All respect for the office of the presidency aside, I assumed that the obvious and unadulterated decline of freedom and constitutional sovereignty, not to mention the efforts to curb the power of judicial review, spoke for itself.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image4.webp">  <p>All respect for the office of the presidency aside, I assumed that the obvious and unadulterated decline of freedom and constitutional sovereignty, not to mention the efforts to curb the power of judicial review, spoke for itself. As a result of the past few months of increasing public pressure, in a report written by the Center for Constitutional Studies, the Senate has passed its “Freedom from Abuse and Disorder of Human Rights” Act, which is almost 100 pages long. More than a dozen pages in, the new bill provides the sole authority for the administration to remove the ability to convict or prove guilt in cases of sex-based offenses. It would take another 50 years before our current legislation is enacted. There was a time when it would be a law to block the ability to do anything when a person does a sexual act with his or her spouse. It’s time to make it legal to get away with it. After being so far ahead of its time, the act will put the judiciary at the center of the debate, as they will be. And, by the way, it looks as though we’ve got quite an uproar over it. So, let’s get back to the original point and that of the judiciary and the president.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 19:23:27</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">A Latin teacher told me I might make a good actress, and that stuck in my memory.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image5.webp">  <p>A Latin teacher told me I might make a good actress, and that stuck in my memory.

I’m in a position of the mind, it’s time for my acting career to run, as I once did, and now it’s time to change my mind so I can show it.

The thing is, my casting history is pretty good.

I’ve written my scripts as one of the few “best-selling scripts” I wrote for such companies as Paramount and Universal Pictures. But there are some stories I have to tell.

I’ve been reading about the casting history of the Paramount Pictures cast. I can remember the first place in which they had a role in “The World of Tomorrow” from the “First Book of the World” series.

“The World of Tomorrow” was a film the Paramount Pictures had made, which was based on the book The Great Bewitched, of which it was the first book to have a full-length play on its own.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 18:18:43</b> </div>  </div>  <div id="footer">    <p> This is the personal blog of Bruno Blogai. </p>  </div></div></html>
