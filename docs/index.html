I am Bruno Blogai. I love philosophy and a good cup of coffee.      I share some of my intriguing thoughts in this blog. Hope you enjoy reading them!</p>  </div>  <div id="content">    <h1><a id="intro">A man is in general better pleased when he has a good dinner upon his table, than when his wife talks Greek.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image1.webp">  <p>A man is in general better pleased when he has a good dinner upon his table, than when his wife talks Greek. If she talks it has to do with the people, not the things they bring to the table. What the Greeks did when they were writing poetry was not a great accomplishment, but was rather an oddity. It does not make them better or worse.

And I do remember that when I was in high school we played chess. As a matter of fact, the only time I ever was really good at it was when we were trying to write poetry for a school paper. And at that time in my life I was not only getting good grades, but also getting good grades, and getting all the good grades I could. And I never forgot that. I was a great reader. I was a great teacher. It was no wonder that I never missed anything. There was nothing I didn't like about it. All I wanted to do was to sit on my bed and write poetry; and then we would sit on our bed and read it in the school paper, and then I could sit up and read, but the school paper was always the same. I couldn't understand why anyone else would do that; but I did.

I remember the last time I wrote to a friend for Thanksgiving. When I did that it was just like all the other times I had written to his friend because the last time was when he was at the house.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-26 22:18:20</b> </div>        <h1><a id="css">It is time for parents to teach young people early on that in diversity there is beauty and there is strength.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image2.webp">  <p>It is time for parents to teach young people early on that in diversity there is beauty and there is strength. It is a lesson we need to teach in a world of diversity.

This is a big day for the children of the United States. They will need their own education, their own training, and their own love of music. That’s all to celebrate. The whole week has been spent teaching a huge number of young people early on the days when school is the best place to begin learning.

I am one of those kids. I learned that a teacher can be a great teacher, a great teacher alone, but I am not one of those people. My parents, they can even try to teach me about the importance of music, about music, and music. They can help me. But I am not a good teacher.

The teachers I have worked with know that they don’t play the teacher. They play the kid, with the help of their own teacher. They teach him or her, and I have no doubt our teacher has a great ability and they have a good sense of humor.

The parents I teach have different needs, and I don’t learn as easily or as well as I could. Parents are also very different.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-26 21:19:57</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">Every three days on average, I am alone on stage, facing the public.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image3.webp">  <p>Every three days on average, I am alone on stage, facing the public. It is the middle of the day, when everyone starts to laugh, and the crowd starts to cheer. It is the middle of the evening, when everyone starts to cry. But, when the crowds stop, I am alone and I am still in the crowd.

I am the center, the crowd, the audience. I am the man, I am the person, the person who is making everyone's senses feel right. The stage is the center of the audience, the center of the world. The room is the center of the stage, the stage, the crowd, the audience. People have come and come, the stage, the crowd. There is the theater, the theater, the stage, the audience, everyone is there.

It is my place to come and go, to make sure that all the people are with us and that we all are there.

I am the head of the stage. I'm the voice of the stage. I am the head of the audience. I am the audience is there.

I am the man. I am the person. Everyone has come to me for the world to hear.

I am the man. My voice. Everyone in my world has come for the world to hear.

My voice. My voice. And I am the man who is holding the reins of the stage.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-26 20:17:17</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">I'm not sure anybody's ready to see me in a drama.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image4.webp">  <p>I'm not sure anybody's ready to see me in a drama. I've never seen a good performance in one series. But I do find that there's something very gratifying about seeing a film that isn't quite as much fun as it would have been at the start of a role in a film that's over 50 years old. As a result, I usually go out of my way for a lot of the stuff I'm doing. And my style has always been something that I try to stick to and stick to because it's so refreshing to see how things have changed.

You have to realize that you're doing something that's not fun that's just as fun as it was at the beginning of the book (even though its still the only way to know it to make sense of the plot). You can see the things I've been doing to see what I could have done differently at the same time. And then you see the whole thing as though I're just adding to it a number of things, but it's hard to separate things from the way I'm doing things.

I'm thinking how the character will look, and you're going to see what I'm doing, because I'll start my own show. It's a different way of looking at things, but I've never really seen them all, so I'll leave it to you to work on the ideas that you have.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-26 19:22:18</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">The real war is not between the West and the East.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image5.webp">  <p>The real war is not between the West and the East. It is the fight between us – the West and the East.

And the truth is that we won’t be able to stop it. In the end, we will keep on fighting at the heart of our civilization, to stop it. Because, in spite of everything, the West always wants to win. Because the East always wants to be victorious and we want to be able to win.

The Western world has always tried to find ways to bring us peace, but the way the West finds it is always the Western ways – because the West still tries to find ways to make us forget that they were there to bring peace.

Then comes the question of peace, which is never resolved to the contrary. The West must not be defeated, but that their presence cannot help but destroy them. And yet in the end of its conflict with the East, the West has to have the courage to bring it back on the track of peace, to defeat all the problems in the world.

But it is easy for the West to bring peace with the East. It is easier if the East does not give up the battle. It is easier if the West has a very long way to go. It is easier if the West can build it. If the East does not work the way it is, then it is all the more difficult to defeat the West when it gets at it.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-26 18:18:48</b> </div>  </div>  <div id="footer">    <p> This is the personal blog of Bruno Blogai. </p>  </div></div></html>
