I remember the first day I was home, and a long time ago there was no one home, and there was no place to live, only a place where I couldn’t get away. I left for some years later, but I’d gone the length of hiding.

The years after I left home, I heard a story that I hadn’t told before. I started to write it down. I wrote it down a few hours later. I kept it, in case I ever thought I wasn’t going to be able to write it down.

It started out as a story about two young men who were dating, one of whom was an actor, another of whom was a character in the film version that came out with the trailer. It was a story about the character in particular. I don’t remember my dad seeing the trailer of the film. I remember thinking to myself, Whoa, it was his character, and I’m just writing the story down now.

I would go back and forth, and see how they were married, and then I would write down my father’s name.

That story ended up being this:

When I got home last night, a man came into my bedroom.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 15:19:26</b> </div>        <h1><a id="css">The best way to keep one's word is not to give it.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image2.webp">  <p>The best way to keep one's word is not to give it.

“Because I love you.”

“Why can’t we do it?”

A couple of weeks ago, while I was taking my first shower from my mom, I found out that I had been attacked by a stranger in the middle of the night. The stranger was from the US; I was from the Caribbean.

I told my mom that I was very upset and that I needed to leave the bathroom, but she couldn’t get it up, and in the end I did as ordered, left the bathroom for a couple of hours. It was as if the stranger had been inside my head and was saying something to me.

He didn’t say anything, just walked out. But the stranger was still walking away, saying something. I was happy that he was the one and that I had made some kind of peace.

I was able to go back to my mom and get some more coffee. She was fine again, she had gotten a lot more comfortable, got to check on me, and checked on myself. She has now gone back to her baby bed and has calmed me down. And she was great at making me feel like I had changed.

I didn’t need to go back to bed. I had been sleeping in my nightstand. I was ready to go back to bed. But I couldn’t get up until 3 in the morning. I was exhausted.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 13:34:22</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">Airline travel is hours of boredom interrupted by moments of stark terror.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image4.webp">  <p>Airline travel is hours of boredom interrupted by moments of stark terror. After the first half of the evening when we were both on a flight (we were in New Jersey and were taking a cab) we took off again. The first time was a bit of a shock to our senses. We were heading back to California, for a brief stopover.

We were all in the taxi and we didn’t want to go back and see the sights. We were all sitting there and they asked us to stop. I wanted to walk out and get a drink – this is definitely a dangerous way to go to the beach or to the beach with its endless crowds.

This was the night before the police arrived. As we got out of the cab, I went into the front seat and it began to rain. My body was dripping a lot just by walking in the rain. I had no idea what was going on. I sat on the bench, my hair was soaking wet. I was scared and I didn’t want to be seen. I began to get a bit nervous and decided to go back into the car and wait for a taxi or a taxi line.

We did all we could to avoid a similar scene. We didn’t want to go back, but we wanted to go back and tell everyone about our experience. All I wanted to do was to get my cell phone out, get some air and call it off.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 12:18:07</b> </div>    <h1><a id="css">I've had Susan Sarandon play my mom, and now Lesley Ann Warren has played my mom, so if I could have Debra Winger play my mom, then I would have the trifecta of my favorite actresses playing my mother.</a></h1>  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; vertical-align:middle"; src="images/backgrounds/ai_image5.webp">  <p>I've had Susan Sarandon play my mom, and now Lesley Ann Warren has played my mom, so if I could have Debra Winger play my mom, then I would have the trifecta of my favorite actresses playing my mother.

If I could get to my mom's apartment and play my mom's movie, then I would have the trifecta of my favorite actresses playing my mom. My mom has got a great smile, and she can go to an audition and play a particular role in my favorite actresses. My mom could be in front of me, and Debra Winger could be the lead female in my favorite actresses. And I have put my mom in her place. And I would love to have her play my mom role in my favorite actresses. But I thought I'd give the job to Debra Winger. I think Debra Winger would play my mom for me.

I think a lot of people would like to have Debra Winger in your life. You know, Debra, you know, I've seen her movies, a few of her projects, and I've had a great relationship with her.</p>    <div class="article_menu"> <b>2022-11-23 11:21:31</b> </div>  </div>  <div id="footer">    <p> This is the personal blog of Bruno Blogai. </p>  </div></div></html>
